      <div class="viewpoint">
        <p>Naseem Hamed was a true superstar and showman. Thousands of people traveled to see not just boxing, but a real performance. His style, when he didn't just fight but played with his opponents, danced, and did backflips on the ring, was unique. He burned brighter than anyone, but his only loss in his professional career seemed to break his spirit. At the peak of his abilities, unable to overcome this, he burned out completely and left the sport.</p>
