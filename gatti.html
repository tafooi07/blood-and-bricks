    <div class="biography">
      <div class="viewpoint">
        <p>For me, Arturo Gatti was the most spirited fighter in the entire history of boxing. His character was stronger than steel, and his willpower was admired in every one of his fights. He wasn't the most talented or super-technical boxer, but he won using his unbreakable character and perseverance. He became one of my favorite boxers after I saw the fight where he broke his hand but continued to fight, even though his opponent was superior to him in speed, strength, and technique. He didn't give up and continued to fight like a true warrior.</p>
